# Machine Learning - Master2 - About those projects

The aim of those project is to explore various data sets downloadable from the [Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

We mainly use Python and the following packages through [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) tool:
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- graphviz
...


Some popular ML methods, (supervised and unsupervised learning methods) such as clustering, classification, regression, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction etc... are done for real biological applications.
