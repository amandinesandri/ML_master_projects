# Machine Learning - Master2 - About this project

The aim of those project is to explore various data sets downloadable from the [Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.
ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

We mainly use Python and the following packages through [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) tool:
numpy
pandas
scipy
matplotlib
statsmodels
...


Some popular ML methods, (supervised and unsupervised learning methods) such as clustering, classification, regression, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction etc... are done for real biological applications.
